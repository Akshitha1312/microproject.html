                <h3>Missile Man of India</h3>
                <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, a visionary and a true gem of India, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His journey from a humble background to becoming one of India’s most respected scientists and leaders is an inspiration to all. Dr. Kalam’s career in science and technology was illustrious. He played a key role in the development of India’s space and missile programs, earning him the title “Missile Man of India.” His work at ISRO and DRDO laid the foundation for India’s advancements in aerospace technology. In 2002, Dr. Kalam assumed the office of the President of India. During his tenure, he continued to inspire the nation with his wisdom and vision for a prosperous and developed India. He was known for his accessibility to students and his commitment to education. His books, including “Wings of Fire” and “Ignited Minds,” have motivated countless young minds to pursue their dreams relentlessly. Dr. Kalam’s love for education led to initiatives like the “Kalam-Raju Tablet,” aimed at providing quality education to remote areas. On July 27, 2015, India lost a great leader and a beloved scientist when Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam passed away. However, his legacy as a role model, a symbol of knowledge, humility, and dedication to the betterment of society, continues to inspire people of all ages and backgrounds, not only in India but around the world.</p>
